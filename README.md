This theme is an easy-to-the-eyes-gnome 3- theme which features dark menu's.

Two versions available:

- brayzill-theme-3.30 : This only works on a gnome 3.30 desktop.

- brayzill-theme>3.29 : A version that works from gnome 3.22 to 3.29.

## How to install:

Just copy the extracted file to a '.themes'-folder you make in your home directory, or better copy to /usr/share/themes for system-wide use.
Then use Tweak-tool to select the GTK.
LOG OUT AND BACK IN for changes to take effect !

## Requirements:

Disable gnome-extensions that reside on the headerbar because they mess up the headerbar-theming.

Window-buttons-layout preferably (min/max/close) at the right side.
